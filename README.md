### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ¤“ I am a medical engineer with 10+ years of experience in international medical companies.
- &#128029; Occasionally started to play with web technologies and ended up learning **C** in [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) (School 42).
  - Recent projects in **C**: [fdf](https://github.com/AntonKilk/fdf), [fillit](https://github.com/AntonKilk/fillit), [get_next_line](https://github.com/AntonKilk/gnl).
- &#128450; My first steps in web dev can be found in my [portfolio](https://github.com/AntonKilk/portfolio).
